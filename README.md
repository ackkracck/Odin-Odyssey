## ðŸ§± Foundations

### ðŸ“– Learning
- [Odin Links & Images](./Foundations/HTML-CSS/odin-links-and-images)
- [Odin Recipes](./Foundations/HTML-CSS/odin-recipes)
- [Interneting Is Hard â€“ Flexbox Project](./Foundations/HTML-CSS/other-projects/interneting-is-hard/flexbox/flexbox.html)

**Things I have learnt:**
- Complete refresher on HTML and CSS fundamentals  
- Deeper dive into Flexbox (and I now love it despite absolutely hating it just yesterday, when I hadn't even finished half of the page) â€” the progress seems to be exponential  
- So excited to start JS!

## ðŸ™Œ JavaScript 
Oh boy, what to say about this section, it was kind of tiresome to go through the js exercises, and I was putting off working on it, but in the end I decided to just complete it to stay on track for this section of the Foundations course.

It honestly paid off, I'm really glad I went through it, I was already decently proficient in JS but it made me comfortable with the language to a moderate level.
