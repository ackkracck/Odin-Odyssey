## 🧱 Foundations

### 📖 Learning
- [Odin Links & Images](./Foundations/exercises/HTML-CSS/odin-links-and-images)
- [Odin Recipes](./Foundations/exercises/HTML-CSS/odin-recipes)
- [Interneting Is Hard – Flexbox Project](./Foundations/exercises/HTML-CSS/other-projects/interneting-is-hard/flexbox/flexbox.html)

**Things I have learnt:**
- Complete refresher on HTML and CSS fundamentals  
- Deeper dive into Flexbox (and I now love it despite absolutely hating it just yesterday, when I hadn't even finished half of the page) — the progress seems to be exponential  
- So excited to start JS!

### 🙌 JavaScript 
Oh boy, what to say about this section, it was kind of tiresome to go through the js exercises, and I was putting off working on it, but in the end I decided to just complete it to stay on track for this section of the Foundations course.

It honestly paid off, I'm really glad I went through it, I was already decently proficient in JS but it made me comfortable with the language to a moderate level.

#### 20th of October 2025 
I've completed up to the DOM manipulation section of the foundations course, and will attempt to next tackle the next rock-paper-scissors project. I have to admit that I haven't been keeping track of every single resource too deeply (nor the additional resources), but there is logic behind this.

If I focus too much on these resources right now, I will be overloaded with information more than my brain can retain - instead I am focusing on understand the possibilities available to me within this language, and can just reference resources later to implement them when needed.

So that's where I am right now - trying to open up my brain to ingrain what's possible. I will have plenty of time later to practice different aspects of JS programming when the need for them arise within projects I am eager to build.
