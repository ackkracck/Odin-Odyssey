## 🧱 Foundations

### 📖 Learning
- [Odin Links & Images](./Foundations/exercises/HTML-CSS/odin-links-and-images)
- [Odin Recipes](./Foundations/exercises/HTML-CSS/odin-recipes)
- [Interneting Is Hard – Flexbox Project](./Foundations/exercises/HTML-CSS/other-projects/interneting-is-hard/flexbox/flexbox.html)

**Things I have learnt:**
- Complete refresher on HTML and CSS fundamentals  
- Deeper dive into Flexbox (and I now love it despite absolutely hating it just yesterday, when I hadn't even finished half of the page) — the progress seems to be exponential  
- So excited to start JS!

### 🙌 JavaScript 
Oh boy, what to say about this section, it was kind of tiresome to go through the js exercises, and I was putting off working on it, but in the end I decided to just complete it to stay on track for this section of the Foundations course.

It honestly paid off, I'm really glad I went through it, I was already decently proficient in JS but it made me comfortable with the language to a moderate level.

#### - 20th of October 2025 
I've completed up to the DOM manipulation section of the foundations course, and will attempt to next tackle the next rock-paper-scissors project. I have to admit that I haven't been keeping track of every single resource too deeply (nor the additional resources), but there is logic behind this.

If I focus too much on these resources right now, I will be overloaded with information more than my brain can retain - instead I am focusing on understand the possibilities available to me within this language, and can just reference resources later to implement them when needed.

So that's where I am right now - trying to open up my brain to ingrain what's possible. I will have plenty of time later to practice different aspects of JS programming when the need for them arise within projects I am eager to build.

#### - 22th (actually now 12:20AM on the 23rd) of October 2025
I've completed the Etch-A-Sketch project! W00t!

Honestly it is still just a chrome app as suggested by my commit message, but I've had some tremendous amount of practice and I actually understand how to program on the front end pretty decently now, and also have a fair amount of practice with branching and merging!

Hope I'm not about to fall into the valley of despair...

Nonetheless, I'm proud of what i've created, and truly excited to click completed on this project and display it on the odin project website. I will definitely come back and fix this project up when i'm putting together my portfolio.

So happy to say that I currently feel pretty comfortable. What I really need to work on right now is the intial planning process where I lay out the actual design of all my projects before I start creating anything, this will give me a well defined structure to follow and implement.

Wish me luck!

- [Odin Project #3 - Etch-A-Sketch](./Foundations/Odin-Projects/etch-a-sketch/)

#### - 25th October 2025 - Odin Project #3
What to say again, this project was told me not to be easy by the odin project, but the minimum viable project truly was easy.

Even before I started I wanted to see all the created projects, so i looked up other community projects and watched youtube videos such as those by @trshpuppy.

I am so proud of what i've created and truly belive it to be the best of all competitors in this course.

starting now...
