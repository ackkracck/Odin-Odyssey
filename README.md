# My 'The Odin Project' Portfolio

A collection of my progress following The Odin Project curriculum.

---

## ðŸ§± Foundations

### ðŸ“– Learning
- [Odin Links & Images](./Foundations/HTML-CSS/odin-links-and-images)
- [Odin Recipes](./Foundations/HTML-CSS/odin-recipes)
- [Interneting Is Hard â€“ Flexbox Project](./Foundations/HTML-CSS/other-projects/interneting-is-hard/flexbox/flexbox.html)

**Things I have learnt:**
- Complete refresher on HTML and CSS fundamentals  
- Deeper dive into Flexbox (and I now love it despite absolutely hating it just yesterday, when I hadn't even finished half of the page) â€” the progress seems to be exponential  
- So excited to start JS!
